# npm Package Research via MCP

Use this skill for in-depth npm package research: bundle sizes, vulnerability scanning, download comparisons, and dependency trees. No API keys needed.

## Available Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `search` | Search npm packages by query |
| `package_info` | Detailed info: description, license, repo, dependencies |
| `downloads` | Download stats for a package |
| `compare_downloads` | Compare download counts across multiple packages |
| `bundle_size` | Bundle size (minified + gzip) via Bundlephobia |
| `vulnerabilities` | Known vulnerability info and advisory links |
| `dependency_tree` | Show direct dependencies as a tree |
| `download_trends` | Daily breakdown with sparkline visualization |

## Workflow

1. For "which library?" questions: `compare_downloads` + `bundle_size` for each candidate
2. For security audits: `vulnerabilities` on each dependency
3. For adoption analysis: `download_trends` to see growth patterns
4. For dependency footprint: `dependency_tree` before adding a new package

## Key Patterns

- `bundle_size` calls Bundlephobia — some packages may not be analyzable (native modules, very large packages)
- `compare_downloads` accepts multiple package names — ideal for "zustand vs jotai vs valtio" comparisons
- `vulnerabilities` checks npm audit advisories — always run this before recommending a package
- `download_trends` includes a text sparkline for quick visual trend assessment
